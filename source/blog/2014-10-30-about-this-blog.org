I haven't yet made concrete plan on how to manage this blog.

* Purpose
I think there is quite big gap between those two : 
- As a personal memo
- For others to read
I'm considering to use this blog with former purpose mostly, and make a special *category* for latter use.

* Language
- English : I will use English in technical postings.
- Korean : As a mother tongue, I feel much more comfortable when writing non-technical things.
