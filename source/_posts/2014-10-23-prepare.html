The length of the cycle must be long enough to accommodate the longest possible propagation delay in the processor. This means that some instructions (typically the arithmetic instructions) will complete quickly, and time will be wasted each cycle. Other instructions (typically memory read or write instructions) will have a much longer propagation delay.

<ul class="org-ul">

Multi-cycle processors break up the instruction into its fundamental parts, and executes each part of the instruction in a different clock cycle. Since signals have less distance to travel in a single cycle, the cycle times can be sped up considerably.

Pipeline bubbling
Main article: Bubble (computing)
</p>

<p>
Bubbling the pipeline, also known as a pipeline break or a pipeline stall, is a method for preventing data, structural, and branch hazards from occurring. As instructions are fetched, control logic determines whether a hazard could/will occur. If this is true, then the control logic inserts NOPs into the pipeline. Thus, before the next instruction (which would cause the hazard) is executed, the previous one will have had sufficient time to complete and prevent the hazard. If the number of NOPs is equal to the number of stages in the pipeline, the processor has been cleared of all instructions and can proceed free from hazards. All forms of stalling introduce a delay before the processor can resume execution.
</p>

<p>
Flushing the pipeline occurs when a branch instruction jumps to a new memory location, invalidating all previous stages in the pipeline. These previous stages are cleared allowing the pipeline to continue at the new instruction indicated by the branch.
Data hazards
</p>

<p>
There are several main solutions and algorithms used to resolve data hazards:
</p>

<p>
insert a pipeline bubble whenever a read after write (RAW) dependency is encountered, guaranteed to increase latency, or
utilize out-of-order execution to potentially prevent the need for pipeline bubbles
utilize operand forwarding to use data from later stages in the pipeline
</p>

<p>
In the case of out-of-order execution, the algorithm used can be:
</p>

<p>
scoreboarding, in which case a pipeline bubble will only be needed when there is no functional unit available
the Tomasulo algorithm, which utilizes register renaming allowing the continual issuing of instructions
</p>

<p>
We can delegate the task of removing data dependencies to the compiler, which can fill in an appropriate number of NOP instructions between dependent instructions to ensure correct operation, or re-order instructions where possible.
Operand forwarding
Main article: Operand forwarding
</p>

<p>
Forwarding involves feeding output data into a previous stage of the pipeline. Forwarding is implemented by feeding back the output of an instruction into the previous stage(s) of the pipeline as soon as the output of that instruction is available.
Examples
</p>

<p>
NOTE: In the following examples, computed values are in bold, while Register numbers are not.
</p>

<p>
For instance, let's say we want to write the value 3 to register 1, (which already contains a 6), and then add 7 to register 1 and store the result in register 2, i.e.:
</p>

<p>
Instruction 0: Register 1 = 6
Instruction 1: Register 1 = 3
Instruction 2: Register 2 = Register 1 + 7 = 10
</p>

<p>
Following execution, register 2 should contain the value 10. However, if Instruction 1 (write 3 to register 1) does not completely exit the pipeline before Instruction 2 starts execution, it means that Register 1 does not contain the value 3 when Instruction 2 performs its addition. In such an event, Instruction 2 adds 7 to the old value of register 1 (6), and so register 2 would contain 13 instead, i.e.:
</p>

<p>
Instruction 0: Register 1 = 6
Instruction 2: Register 2 = Register 1 + 7 = 13
Instruction 1: Register 1 = 3
</p>

<p>
This error occurs because Instruction 2 reads Register 1 before Instruction 1 has committed/stored the result of its write operation to Register 1. So when Instruction 2 is reading the contents of Register 1, register 1 still contains 6, not 3.
</p>

<p>
Forwarding (described below) helps correct such errors by depending on the fact that the output of Instruction 1 (which is 3) can be used by subsequent instructions before the value 3 is committed to/stored in Register 1.
</p>

<p>
Forwarding applied to our example means that we do not wait to commit/store the output of Instruction 1 in Register 1 (in this example, the output is 3) before making that output available to the subsequent instruction (in this case, Instruction 2). The effect is that Instruction 2 uses the correct (the more recent) value of Register 1: the commit/store was made immediately and not pipelined.
</p>

<p>
With forwarding enabled, the ID/EX or Instruction Decode/Execution stage of the pipeline now has two inputs: the value read from the register specified (in this example, the value 6 from Register 1), and the new value of Register 1 (in this example, this value is 3) which is sent from the next stage (EX/MEM) or Instruction Execute/Memory Access. Additional control logic is used to determine which input to use.
Control hazards (branch hazards)
</p>

<p>
To avoid control hazards microarchitectures can:
</p>

<p>
insert a pipeline bubble (discussed above), guaranteed to increase latency, or
use branch prediction and essentially make educated guesses about which instructions to insert, in which case a pipeline bubble will only be needed in the case of an incorrect prediction
</p>

<p>
In the event that a branch causes a pipeline bubble after incorrect instructions have entered the pipeline, care must be taken to prevent any of the wrongly-loaded instructions from having any effect on the processor state excluding energy wasted processing them before they were discovered to be loaded incorrectly.

Both processes and threads are independent sequences of execution.

Threads differ from traditional multitasking operating system processes in that:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>processes are typically independent, while threads exist as subsets of a process
</li>
<li>processes carry considerably more state information than threads, whereas multiple threads within a process share process state as well as memory and other resources
</li>
<li>processes have separate address spaces, whereas threads share their address space
</li>
<li>processes interact only through system-provided inter-process communication mechanisms
</li>
<li>context switching between threads in the same process is typically faster than context switching between processes.
